# About "Pizza Project"

This is a project in Power BI which I created from scratch using data from website https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground.

I started with ETL process, then I built data model. First, I joined the tables using primary and foreign keys, then I continued following a few rules:
using one-to-many relationshps, one way filter flow, showing downstream dataflow. 

The next step was to create a calendar table with a calculated columns.
Then I moved on to data visualization. In the project, I wanted to show the ability to create and use measures. My goal was to extract as much insight as possible from the available data.

I also wanted the design to be aesthetic, so I used the formatting function.
