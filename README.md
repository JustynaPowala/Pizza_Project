# About "Pizza Project"

This is a project in Power BI which I created from scratch using data from website https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground.
My goal was to extract as much insight as possible from the available data.
Thanks to my work, Pizzeria Owners see things that They didn't see when looking at the data tables. A glance is enough to see where they stand, which pizzas sell the best, and which ones could be removed from the menu or given promotions. Information about the highest occupancy can help them in determining the work schedules of workers.


I started with ETL process, then I built data model. First, I joined the tables using primary and foreign keys, then I continued following a few rules:
using one-to-many relationshps, one way filter flow, showing downstream dataflow. 

The next step was to create a calendar table with a calculated columns.
Then I moved on to data visualization. In the project, I wanted to show the ability to create and use measures. My goal was to extract as much insight as possible from the available data.

I also wanted the design to be aesthetic, so I used the formatting function.
